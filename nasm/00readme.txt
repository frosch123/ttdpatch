This directory contains some patches to NASM, to make it work correctly
for TTDPatch.  It also contains an updated nasm.exe compiled for use in the
Cygwin environment and one for Linux.

nasm-0.98.39-misc.gz - contains the following changes:
   * fix bug that causes output of incorrect offsets in the .lst file
   * fix forward references forcing rel32 offsets
   * fix instruction order to be tasm compatible
   * list expanded macro parameters
   * warn if byte-sized or word-sized address operands are out of bounds
   * coff output: make all sections with bss in their name use BSS_FLAGS
nasm-0.98.39-listsect.gz - list section names for relocatable symbols
nasm-0.98.39-opsizeimm.gz - warn about operations whose size is 
   determined from an immediate operand
nasm-0.98.39-assume-autogen.gz - when generating dependencies, assume that
   misssing %includes are autogenerated, like gcc -MM

These patches work for nasm versions from 0.98.39 on, most of them will fail
on earlier versions (due to fundamental changes in the source indentation)

nasm - nasm compiled for Linux (needs GLIBC >= 2.3)
nasm.exe - nasm compiled for Cygwin

The osx directory holds patches specific for OS X.
