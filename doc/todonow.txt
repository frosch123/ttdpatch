=-=-= Very urgent =-=-=

- when changing console size, remember current settings

- fix large ships tip not being drawn properly; check ship motion and
  redrawing of the main window; should have the size calculation there

- make planting more than one tree in a square affect city ratings, but
  perhaps not as much

- make remove industry apply only for dynamite, instead of requiring Ctrl key

- too much diesel smoke when train is slowed down by bridge speed limit

- make elrails cost change in time, something like
  mx - (mx-mn)/(fix(steps*log(1+(2000-1920)/scale))/steps) * fix(steps*log(1+(year-1920)/scale))/steps])
  mx=8 mn=1.6 steps=3 scale=8
  use bsf instead of log, of course

- newttdsprites array is no longer necessary, except for swapping tunnel
  icons; swap their spriteoffsetinfile values instead
  oh, and for el.rails construction icons, those might be a bit more difficult

- clean up sources; get rid of all now-useless #if 0 .. #endif and
  commented blocks

- delivering cargo to industry: tests station origin, should test origin
  of all facilities instead. maybe also fix that only one industry receives
  all goods

- make grftrans able to use both .grf and _trans.grf to have only the new
  entries untranslated

- bug: writecfg ttdpatch.cfg overwrites currently open files and causes confusion

- !!! Improve/automate defining flags for patchflags in action 7. Also have
  them set by C code, not in assembly to save some protected code bytes

- callback for wagon capacity and weight

- callback for cost factor/running cost factor

- update copyright notices; switches.c and ttdpatchw.rc

- change msg if messageboxw not avail to show error loc or something

- flag for "station is really depot"

- newstations flags to build fences for +x/+y and -x/-y sides

- change realistic curves to use constant drag force instead
  e.g. each curve = 25 kN, but how to handle single loco & short trains?

- veh sort age in percent, not absolute

- wagons converted engines don't make category become available

- different graphics for electr. depot using action 5

- supporting reversing artic locos

- make dual-headed artics work

- autorenew doesn't deal correctly with multihead locos (price)

- keep cargo as well when selling&buying vehicle; remember both vehs for planes
  and dual-headed trains

- buildonslopes off doesn't turn it off...

- allow grf setting baseline year to allow fake years before 1920

- conflict with morecurrencies in ttdpttxt; setting euro intro to 0 is taken
  as default setting, not new setting

- reset vehicles should also reset track types available, and large airport?
  or maybe the latter should be taken care of by cht: year

- add AI airport selection

- grftrans can't translate new station names
  -> make it write action 0 feature 4 prop 8 set to FFFFFFF, make that use the
     mapping of the previous .grf ?
  -> action 13 ?

- morecurrencies overwrites default curr selection (not GBP in BE version)

- provide support for long train vehicles composed of two vehicles?  maybe
  emulate bogeys like Locomotion has them

- tie heliport&large airport intro dates to first heli and jet?

- remove set name from grf stat status box; add sprite&mem info?

- make clicking on news history item open that one immediately (maybe even
  in paused mode?), instead of adding it to the end of the list

- change station rating calc with wagonspeedlimits

- airport problem, http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=237282#237282

- fix perf score overflow: bsr ecx,ebx; sub ecx,16; jb .noshift; shr ebx,cl; .noshift:

- combine all newgraphics options into one bitswitch, then newgraphics.rvs on etc.

- check malloc works with chunks > 128 KB

- split the various miscmods generalfixes into their own patchprocs to make
  the procs smaller, using the new direct bit tests for miscmods checks

- check why newshistory needs enhancedgui? and fix if necessary

- no loading states for planes?

- faster loading/unloading at bus stops

- station list too limited by TTD's max drop down size, also crashes if too many?

- nowires variable needs to be rethought

- refitting crash, http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=262819#262819

- when selecting station type that makes cur size invalid, choose closest not largest

- company colours for rotors

- way to show different sprites in veh list/veh details/depot

- crash when building higher bridge, http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=265905#265905

- don't autoclose station building window if it's pinned (others too)

- define bridge prop to change bboxes, add action 1/2/3 support for bridges

- add action 1/2/3 support for bus stops (new pre-def class? flag? selection?)

- in grf status window in scen ed, add state "do not save", make this default

- crash with newstations 0.4, see http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=278809#278809

- save is-in-PBS-block for station, and also prop 15 (in tileproc, 256 ticks=3.5 days)

- need to record "reserve" results to preserve them across loads even if order
  of grf files changes
  -> when saving, save only those reserved IDs that are in use in the game
     (make new table "checkreservedIDinuse" or something; call when saving;
      save reserved ID if any in range is in use)
  -> also support multiple reserve/find per feature (record FFFFFFFF as GRFID
     in reserve table, then clear all FFFFFFFF for next grf)
  -> disallow this type of Action D if GRFID is FFxxxxxx

- allow building station tiles with station ID = FE or FF or something, that
  doesn't create station structure; to allow building e.g. buffers

- update tools site with http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Stadium/8515/downloads.htm

- add to crash log a list of GRFIDs and the CRC of the corresponding files

- coop feature for other vehicle types too

- draw transparent sprites properly in station construction window
  (regular and LoMo GUI)

- initialize newcargos text IDs

- add default refit ratio for cargos

- add veh2ofs (or not, wrong size) ptrvar

- show yellow income/cost messages for feeder service drop-off/pick-up

- cache station var 40+x, when updating cache also check PBS state for each
  platform for better var 44
  -> one D l-array that allocates cache-structs on demand? will not work in DOS
     b/o locking pages not allowing to allocate memory later
  -> prealloc 6 D/tile?

- multihead initially wrong speed: http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=354243#354243

- resolution 640x480 causes giantscreenshot patch to fail, see
  http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=487192#487192
  should move that patch before resolution patches?

- use one bit per signal for PBS state to allow two-way single-side-PBS signals

- new string code to choose normal size

==== Rather urgent =====

- change sprite drawing to use z-buffer instead of sprite sorter
  see #tycoon log 2006-03-09 starting 11:49:55

- implement change to the seed of town growth, not just town.xy but also
  from tiles near stations in the vicinity (airports and rail stations
  have always been centers of city development historically)

- new industry flag: like farm, but plant trees not fields

- change IsTrainInSignalBlock to use position hash; must take tunnels into
  account correctly!

- higherbridges too cheap

- show cargo symbols for planes, possibly (refittable?) rvs and ships too

- allow repeating current order list in reverse order, for ships to find the
  way back (of course skipping current last and first order)

- no (or lower) running costs for electric heads on non-electric tracks

- when loading unknown chunks, keep their data and save it when saving game
  again to prevent game breaking when loaded in version which does treat them

- show height level in tile query info

- allow long-range subsidies too

- giantscreenshotsize n; make giant screenshot of n x n screens

- modify train pathfinding to prefer straight and level routes; change it from
  a shortest-distance algorithm to least-cost algorithm, with some balance
  between cost due to distance, curves and inclines

- implement George's 24-dir action 1 for road vehicles turning

- for vehlist sorting, build sortvar list with two DWORDs: one for vehicle, one
  for the property which is being sorted. then sort the sortvar list directly,
  without going to the veh struct, this should speed up sorting and make
  writing a better algorithm easier

- check for duplicate grfs and show warning if GRFID exists already

- town stats with growth mode 2: maybe show growth rate if debugging?

- lowering/raising land removes exclusive land use signs?

- in town, show "Population: 600 (snow)" or "Population: 600 (desert)"

- use TTD's cache for TTDPatch sprites (at least in lowmemory mode?)

- large sprites (also buildings) sometimes don't get drawn properly, e.g.
  the cruise ship sometimes has the tip cut off
  -> just set veh.box_coord properly?
  try changing the two immediate operands at 16A4D1 from 6 to some larger
  value, and setting the following two at minus half that value
  (i.e. currently they're -3)

- make feeder service optional by selecting both load and unload at an order

- make station coverage depend on size: large airports bigger, small airports
  normal, similar for train stations.

- when refitting planes/trains, show mail, and show passengers/mail as well
  as just passengers

- Presignals don't look right in toyland, where signals look different

- Bug: Industry acceptance is mostly ignored

- !! BUG !! Pre-signals crashes if too large chunks without signals present
  (this is a bug in TTD; stack overflow. Maybe I can fix it anyway?)

- Include depots "usefully" in a pre-signal block.
  Idea: when depot checks whether block is clear, count pre, exit & combos
  if (pre&exit) or combo present, depot "signal" acts like pre-signal
  then placing combo-signal in front of depot makes depot act like
  a sponge; otherwise it's not interfering with the regular station
  operation

- Makefile: make install dirs an environment parameter in .bat files

- DOS version: save interrupt vectors before calling TTD, restore afterwards,
  so that the DOS version doesn't lock up/crash/catch fire when TTD crashes

- signals in tunnels & on bridge.
  could work like this: when last waggon leaves bridge ramp/tunnel entrance,
  set signal green.  Whenever entering a new fake square, fudge the signal
  check to return yes, and red or green depending on train on the next
  square
  (all this only if the signals are valid, i.e. two one ways, both same way)

- store language data in resource section for Windows version

- renew wagons along with engine

- make Cht: Semaphores cost, equal to difference between placing and removing
  a signal for each signal

- slowdown on bridges and before crossings as long as any wagon is on them

- support train prop 21=06 or 07, problem is @16046b, the cmp al/cl,2/-2,
  won't trigger right if prior vehicle is too short

- in orders menu, make skip change to "skip to" when an order is selected

- redraw screen after processing key [2]/[8] in the scenario editor's Land
  generation window

- UTF-8 colour codes broken, http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=489083#489083

=====  Not so urgent  =====

- if vehicle rename fails, don't close edit window

- Cht to reset "will not get exclusive offers" flag

- when building tunnel, not only try lowering one corner of other side but
  also try raising other corner; do what's cheapest of the two

- allow trains to go backwards: fake it by reversing the order, and copying
  all engine data from the real engine to the new first wagon; make sure to
  always reverse it when entering a depot.  Will require multihead on to work.
  perhaps show "correct" (unreversed) order in train window to avoid confusion

- improved steam displays; new sprites for each direction, different sprites
  if engine is using more power

- show destinations in train and rv lists, like planes and ships

- for trucks, resolve traffic jams by disabling the collision detection

- how about ship speed > 127 km/h?

- for normally dualheaded engines, count twice as many heads half as much
  (i.e., each unit of two gives same advantage as one unit for regular engines)

- allow updating vehicle data as game is running?

- maintenance cost for tracks?

- power efficiency factor; or better: internal power used to calc. accel
  plus power displayed in all vehicle windows

- endyear or gameduration to go with startyear

- high-speed bridges; length 2-inf; expensive (possible?), look=just base, no cover
  also Cht: UpgradeBridges [to [from]]

- One line in CFG file should be version number. Then new versions should
  ask "New version of TTDPatch, update CFG file?" if ttdpatch.cfg exists
  (if N is answered still update it, but only change the version number!)
  This should take obsolete values into account.  But what about players who
  try out a new version but then go back to the old one?

- Refit both plane compartments separately; also choose relative size?

- minimum load; never leave a station if less than X percent full.  Perhaps
  only if not forced unload.

- Faster scrolling with ctrl-shift.Extremely fast.

- Stocks: get part of profit, get money for selling stock. If 75% owned
  company goes bankrupt, only pay 25%

- Airport number: Make noise units depend on city size!
  all cities have 2 at least, up to 400 inhabitants, where
  they get another one.  Then every 300(?) they get one more.  Up to?

- Cht: MaxRatings

- Increased production, higher limits.

- Company value doesn't include stations,vehicles,track.  When buying a
  company, bank balance is returned immediately (i.e. buy for free)

- Cht: GlobalAd 0..2, does Small..Large ad campaign at all stations not
  only close to a city

- Stations: Load fuller trains first
  and if next train waiting, leave station -> check after signal
  allow loading of n trains per cargo if more than n*somesetting
  units waiting

- Cht: OwnCrossing should determine the owner by tracing the tracks

- Plane: Crash instead of getting slower, but much more rarely, and try
  to crash where they are not at airport. Option to disable all crashes

- Max Loan = 10% of real comp.value (w/o cur.loan) + initial loan

- RV's: no collision detection in the station

- Restrict switches for competitions

- automatic cht: owncrossing after sellout/bankruptcy

- Prevent landscape changes unless good standing.  Big penalties.

- Improve ship pathfinding for longer distances.  Diagonal not north then west

- Larger tile sizes in the editor.

- add option in menu to jump between editor and playing

- some hydroplanes that land on water and use the boat docks?

- fullloadany should be optional by vehicle type

- link ratings and cargo of several stations to "simulate" several facilities
  of each type

- cargo payment rates should follow supply and demand rules

- make economy fluctuations smoother, e.g. changes or +/- 10%, but more often.
  +/- 50% should be rare.

- limit station capacity according to facilities attached

- sign cheat to force all vehicles (or of some type) into the depot; like
  clicking the "depot" button

- in vehicle window title: show "veh. name (old)" or something

- Cht: NewCompany to force a new AI company to appear (independent of
  difficulty?), of course only if slot available
