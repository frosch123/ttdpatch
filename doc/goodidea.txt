2.13  Disallowing switches
---------------------------

Because this program makes it too easy to cheat at competitions, this switch
is included to help.

Select the switches you don't mind your players to use, add -D (capital D)
and save your scenario or game *under a different name*.

This will make it impossible to load the game with any of the other switches
set, causing a protection fault (the only reasonably safe way to abort loading
a game).  Not even you will be able to load it with other switches, which is
why it is important to save it under a different name.

For example, if you'd like to disallow mammoth trains and the increased
station spread, just use every switch but -oe and add -D:

ttdpatch -afilnqswy -x 1 -mc 13 -trpb 240 -D

It doesn't matter what any of the numbers are, just that the switches are
present.  Any switches you forget on the command line can't be used by the
players.

-u and -o will always be possible to use, but they aren't unfair advantages
if they're used anyway.

I think it is safe to allow use of the sign cheat, because these cheats are
recorded anyway and can be checked with the "Cht: Used".  Automatic track
conversion is just too useful, but if you disallow the other sign cheats, you
can check up on your players with "Cht: Used".
