sv2flip - flips both players of a TTD multiplayer game

Copyright (C) 2003 by Josef Drexler.

Use sv2flip to resynch a TTD multiplayer game after a few years
of playing.

In multiplayer games in TTD, it often happens that as time goes
on, the games on both computers slowly drift apart.  This is the
result of TTD's very crude networking algorithms, and unless the
two computers are identical in speed, these small time differences
will add up and eventually cause problems in the games.

To resynch, you use one savegame from either computer, copy it
to the other computer, and flip the players in this copy using
sv1flip.  Then, both games a synched perfectly again, because
they are identical copies.  Of course, they will become desynched
again after some time, so you have to repeat this process every
once in a while.

Here's how you do it:
- find savegame (eg. trt02.sv2) on one computer
- delete, or better rename, original savegame on other computer
- copy trt02.sv2 to other computer
- on other computer, install sv1fix and sv1codec
- run "sv2flip trt02.sv2"
- start TTD and load the game


Maybe I will come up with a better solution, perhaps a way to
do this resynching in game, but that's fairly unlikely...
