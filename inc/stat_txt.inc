// define with	stxt <id>,<string>
// you can add additional lines with "db" following the stxt definition,
// they will become part of the string
//
// use with e.g. mov ax,statictext(<id>)
//
// example:
//
// stxt helloworld,"Hello World!",13,10,0
// stxt multiline,"This is the first line.",13,10
// stxt_cont	db "This is the second line.",13,10,0

//
// For reference, some of the special codes:
//	7B: print dword
//	7C: print signed word
//	7D: print signed byte
//	7E: print unsigned word
//	7F: print dword in currency units
//	80: print substring (TID from ref stack)
//	81: print substring (TID from next 2 bytes)
//	82: print date (day, month, year)
//	83: print month and year
//	84: print signed word in speed units
//	85: pop word from ref stack
//	86: rotate up last 3 words on ref stack
//	87: print signed word in litres
//	9A: print unsigned qword
